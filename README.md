# How Config files are setup.

Using MMengine's config file parser, we can write config files directly in Python and use an inheritance config structure to avoid redundant configurations. This can be achieved by specifing config files to inherit from using the 
```_base_=['my_config.py']``` 
special variable at the top of config files. More information is available at [mmengine config docs](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_tutorials/config.html).

In learned_aggragation, configuration files are logically separated into different directories based on the task to be executed: ```config/meta_test```,```config/meta_train```, and ```config/sweeps```. 

# Setting up a sweep
To sweep over the hyperparameters of a model during meta-testing, one can simply specify a sweep configuration using the ```sweep_config``` variable.
